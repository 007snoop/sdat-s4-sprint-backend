# SDAT S4 Sprint API - Backend Documentation

Welcome to the backend API for the SDAT S4 Sprint Project.  
This is a RESTful Java Spring Boot API hosted on **AWS EC2**, with images stored in **Amazon ECR**, and IAM roles handling secure access.  

Live API (EC2 public IP or domain):

## üöÄ AWS Deployment Architecture

- **Spring Boot Backend** is built into a Docker image.
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** stores the built Docker image (`airportsim-backend`).
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD:** on each push, the workflow builds the image and pushes to ECR.
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** runs the container using `docker run` or `docker-compose`.
- **IAM Role/Policy:** grants EC2 permission to pull images from ECR securely.
- **MySQL Database:** hosted on AWS RDS or locally inside EC2 (configurable via environment variables).

**Flow:**
1. Push to GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions builds Docker image.
2. Push image to **ECR**.
3. EC2 pulls the new image and runs container.
4. API is exposed on EC2 at `:8080/api/...`.

## üîí IAM & Security

* **IAM Role:** EC2 instance role allows pulling private images from ECR without static credentials.
* **ECR Repository Policy:** grants push/pull to CI/CD GitHub Action role and pull to EC2 instance role.
* **Secrets:** Database credentials managed via **AWS Secrets Manager** or environment variables.
* **CORS:** configured in `application.properties` to allow trusted frontend origins.

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

* All responses are JSON.
* `PATCH` and `PUT` require the `id` in the path.
* `POST` is only for **create**, not update.
* Hibernate auto-creates tables (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`).
